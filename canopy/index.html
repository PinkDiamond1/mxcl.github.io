<p>Canopy brings real‐time notifications to GitHub. Respond to people promptly;
  have real‐time conversations on pull‐requests and issues; get the job done
  faster and more efficiently; and—most importantly—stay on top of development.</p>

<p>Tapping Canopy’s notifications opens the relevant GitHub page in your web-browser;
  no more hunting through emails for the link.</p>

<p>Canopy for Mac is free for open source (public repos) with a subscription for
  private repos. Canopy for iOS is $5 for lifetime notifications for
  public repos, private repos require a subscription. A subscription in
  either app works in the other.</p>
  
<p><small><i>Canopy operates using <b>webhooks</b>, you need to be admin on the
  repositories for which you want notifications, or you need to ask an admin to install
  the hook via the Canopy app or manually</i>.</small></p>

<p>How does Canopy work? <A href="https://medium.com/@mxcl/server-side-swift-making-canopy-2ed586b7f5a9">Max Howell writes about Canopy’s technology stack</a> as part of a six part series.


<a name="faq"><h2>FAQ</h2></a>

<dl>
  <dt><p>Why does Canopy ask for <b>full</b> access to my repositories?</p></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>GitHub does not provide sufficient granularity in its permissions system, thus in order
  to receive events for your private repositories we have to ask for full-access permissions.</p>
    <p>Needless to say Canopy does not write to your repos.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><p>New repositories on my username are not automatically enrolled</p></dt>
  <dd><p>There is no webhook for new repositories on usernames (unlike organizations) so we cannot know
    when you create new repositories. In future we can run a lookup server-side at regular intervals but
    this even this method will introduce some lag time. Hopefully github will add username-hooks.</p></dd>

  <dt><p>I don’t get notifications when my Mac is off</p></dt>
  <dd><p>Apple buffer an undefined number of notifications while devices are off, so some notifications
    will be lost while your device is unpowered. Note this condition also applies to iOS, it’s just
    that your iOS device is almost never off; instead it is usually in stand-by.</p></dd>

  <dt><p>I don’t get any notifications</p></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Ensure you have enabled some, in the app select repositories for which
      you want to receive notifications and tap the checkbox.
    <p>If you still don’t receive notifications visit that repository on GitHub
      and ensure the Canopy webhook is enabled, Canopy does this for you, but it
      may have been disabled by another user or tool. Alternatively turning
      notifications off and on again for that repository will reinstall the hook.</p>
    <p>If you still don’t get notifications, rebooting your Mac will restart the
      APNs service, which may help.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><p>I can’t enable notifications</p></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Ensure you have selected the repository you want notifications for and tap the “Receive push notifications” checkbox.</p>
    <p>Canopy will not be able to install webhooks unless you are admin for that repository, contact the admin and ask them to
      install the webhook. They do not need to use Canopy to install the hook, there are instructions for doing it manually below,
      but the most simple way is for them to install Canopy and then tap “Receive push notifications”.</p>
    <p>You can still enroll for notifications in advance, when the admin creates the hook you will receive a notification about it.</p>
    <p>You cannot get notifications for private repositories unless you create a Canopy subscription.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><p>Do I need to leave the app open?</p></dt>
  <dd><p>No, your push notifications will arrive even if the app has been quit.</p></dd>

  <dt><p>I cannot see a particular private repo.</p></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The GitHub API does not return results for private repositories that are forked
      from private repositories (for OAuth apps like Canopy).</p>
    <p>We plan to fix this by updating our backend to be a proper GitHub app.</p>
    <p>In the meantime you can add repositories that are not visible in the Canopy
      app manually via the “File” menu.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><p>I do not get certain notifications I was expecting</p></dt>
  <dd><p>Canopy can only report activity that is supported by GitHub’s webhook system,
    notably this does not include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Activity on other people’s repositories that you are watching†</li>
      <li>Activity on tickets (at other people’s repositories) where you participated†</li>
      <li>Activity on your gists</li>
      <li>Repository rename events</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Notably, we also don’t send notifications for your <em>own</em>
      activity.</p>
    <p>† Unless the repository owner installs the Canopy webhook <em>and</em> you
      manually add that repository to Canopy (though in the future we will add the
      option to automatically send these notifications, provided the webhook is
      installed still).</p>
  </dd>
  
  <dt><p>Can I get notifications for repositories unrelated to my account?</p><dt>
  <dd><p>Yes, <strong>if</strong> they are open source and <strong>if</strong> they have the 
    Canopy webhook installed, if they don’t have the hook installed you can ask them to
    install it (see the above FAQ), really, there’s no reason they shouldn’t.</p>
    <p>If the above conditions are met you can enroll in notifications manually using the
      ”Add Repository” entry in the “File” menu.</p></dd>

  <dt><p><a name="manual-install"></a>Can I install the Canopy webhook without the app?</p></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If someone has asked you to install the Canopy webhook so they can receive
      notifications, you don’t need to install Canopy to do this.</p>
    <p>Simply add <code>https://canopy.codebasesaga.com/github</code> to any
      repository’s webhooks, ensure its content‐type is <code>application/json</code>) and
      tick “Send me everything”. See the screenshot below.</p>
      <img width=730 height=767 src="screenshot-webhook-settings.png">
    <p>The URL for a repository’s webhooks is of this form:</p>
    <p><b>https://github.com/YOU/REPO/settings/hooks</b></p>
    <p><em>Note, if you do it this way we cannot install a “secret” which means we
      cannot be fully sure that the payloads we receive are from GitHub and not
      someone pretending to be GitHub. If this worries you, install the hook
      using the app.</em></p>
    <p><b>Important</b>, for organizations install the organization webhook. Webhooks on repos
      for organizations have issues with with our apps.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><p>How does Canopy ensure that only people with access get notifications about my private repositories?</p></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When users enroll in notifications for a private repository our backend sends a HEAD request for that user to
      check they actually have access.</p>
    <p>We do an additional HEAD request for all <i>enrolled</i> users before sending push notifications in response to
      webhook events.</p>
    <p>This means we will stop sending notifications for team members you remove from a repository the
      moment you do so.</p>
    <p>If the HEAD request fails we delete that user’s enrollment. If in the future you 
      give them access back, they will have to re-enroll using the Canopy app.</p>
  </dd>
  
  <dt><p>Will my subscription in the macOS app work with the iOS app?</p></dt>
  <dd><p>Yes, your subscription in either app will apply the same benefits to the other.</p></dd>
  
  <dt><p>How about GitHub Enterprise?</p></dt>
  <dd><p>Feature coming soon!</p>

  <dt><p>Our company requires that <em>we</em> run the server&hyphen;side component</p></dt>
  <dd><p>We are happy to provide the server-side binary, compiled for your
    platform, so that your data never leaves your control if you are serious
    in your needs <a href="mailto:mxcl@me.com">contact us</a> for
    terms.</p></dd>
    
  <dt><p>How about Android, Linux and Windows?</p></dt>
  <dd><p>If Canopy is successful (and not Sherlocked) we will make apps for the
    other platforms</p></dd>

  <dt><p>How can I stay updated?</p></dt>
  <dd><p>The App Store updates your apps automatically, but if you want
    informational updates: follow <a href="https://twitter.com/mxcl">@mxcl</a>
    on Twitter.</p></dd>
  
  <dt><p>I have a suggestion</p></dt>

  <dt>What “cloud” data does Canopy keep?</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>The identifiers of the repositories for which you receive notifications</li>
      <li>Your GitHub OAuth token, AES encrypted with unique initialization vectors†</li>

  <dt>Why does Canopy collect this data?</dt>
  <dd><p>GitHub sends Canopy webhooks for repository events, Canopy must know for which repositories you wish to
    receive notifications and which devices you wish these notifications sent. Your GitHub OAuth token is
    required so Canopy can check you <strong>still</strong> have access to private repositories, and so Canopy’s backend can install
    webhooks at GitHub.</p></dd>
    
  <dt>How can I be forgotten?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Signing out of the Canopy app deletes all your tokens from our database, but we persist your enrollment choices in case you later sign back in.</p>
