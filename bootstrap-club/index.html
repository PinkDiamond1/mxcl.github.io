        Big Tech see you as a cog in their machine.
        You’re a developer or a designer, a UX expert or a marketing guru, a product director or a… whatever; you’re assigned a title and you stay in your lane.
      </p>
      <p>
        Something about this has always irked you. You’ve never just done one job, <b>you do all of them.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        There’s no place for you in Big Tech. In fact, <i>they actively don’t want you</i>.<br />
        They know you’d rock the boat.
      </p>
      <h2>Introducing Bootstrap Club</h2>
      <p>
        We made a place for you.
        Join an exclusive, members&hyphen;only club of innovators who <i>get you</i>.
        Network with like&hyphen;minded superstars; meet, learn, and grow.
      </p>
      <h2>What You Get</h2>
      <p>
        Exclusive access to our private Discord full of like minded top-tier
        entrepeneurs, all experts (or budding experts)
        at programming, product, architecture, marketing, sales and innovation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The general channel is noisy but <i>oh what wonderful noise</i>.
        Over time we will very carefully add new channels for more specific topics.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also have an exclusive and unique perk, <b>a private channel
          of the five people who joined at the same time as you</b>.
        We believe five people is the right number of people to start something special.
        We believe you will prove it.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is also an invite&hyphen;only channel for the cream of our community.
        We are unashamedly meritocratic.

      <h2>Buying a Ticket</h2>
      <p>
        We’re a club for those with an eye on the horizon and thus <i>reward early&hyphen;adopters</i>; <b>membership
          increases every time someone joins</b>.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Membership requires you own a Bootstrap Club Ticket.</b></li>
        <li>Tickets are NFTs available at <a href="https://opensea.io">OpenSea</a>.</li>
        <li>
          There is an initial supply of 10 tickets at 0.029Ξ,
          these tickets represent the most popular formula in Homebrew.
          After these are sold 40 more tickets will be made available at 0.01Ξ.
        </li>
        <li>After this, new tickets are “Dutch Auctioned”† starting twice the price of the Bootstrap Club Ticket floor
          with a reserve that is 101% of the floor.</li>
      </ul>

      <p style="opacity: 0.7">† The price gradually falls. This allows us to price ticket value to market demand.</p>

      <p>
        Your ticket has <i>intrinsic value</i>,
        as more people join and demand increases the value increases accordingly.
        Bootstrap club is a <b>fantasic club</b>,
        but one day the price you can get for reselling your ticket
        may make you pause and consider selling it on and leaving the club.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your admission to our Discord is contingent on owning a ticket,
        the moment you sell you’ll be ejected.
      </p>
