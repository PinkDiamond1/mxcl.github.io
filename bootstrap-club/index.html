        Big Tech see you as a cog in their machine.
        You’re a developer or a designer, a UX expert or a marketing guru, a product director or a… whatever; you’re assigned a title and you stay in your lane.
      </p>
      <p>
        This has always irked you—you’ve never done just one job, <b>you do all of them.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        There’s no place for you in Big Tech. In fact, <i>they actively don’t want you</i>.<br />
        They know you’d rock the boat.
      </p>
      <h2>Introducing Bootstrap Club</h2>
      <p>
        We made a place for you.
        Join an exclusive, members&hyphen;only club of innovators who <i>get you</i>.
        Network with like&hyphen;minded superstars; meet, learn, and grow.
      </p>
      <h2>What You Get</h2>
      <p>
        Exclusive access to our private Discord full of like minded top-tier
        entrepeneurs, all experts (or budding experts)
        at programming, product, architecture, marketing, sales and innovation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The general channel is noisy but <i>oh what wonderful noise</i>.
        Over time we will very carefully add new channels for more specific topics.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also have an exclusive and unique perk, <b>a private channel
          of the five people who joined at the same time as you</b>.
        We believe five people is the right number of people to start something special.
        We believe you will prove it.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is also an invite&hyphen;only channel for the cream of our community.
        We are unashamedly meritocratic.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Joining Bootstrap Club</h2>
      <p>
        Membership requires a ticket. The tickets are NFTs listed on <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/bootstrap-club">OpenSea</a>.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>There is an initial supply of 29 tickets</li>
        <li>Each morning the supply will be supplemented up to 5 as necessary</li>
        <li>New tickets are listed for 24 hours at 150% the floor price</li>
        <li>Each morning unsold tickets will be relisted 10% reduced</li>
        <li>Relisted tickets will not be reduced lower than 80% of the collection’s floor</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The above rules maintain a price&hyphen;correcting market with built in scarcity.
        Thus your ticket has <i>intrinsic value</i>;
        as more people join and demand increases the value will increase accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tickets are non-fungible,
        thus you are free to sell your ticket at any time at any price on any (NFT) marketplace.
        If you sell them on OpenSea they will be listed alongside ours.
        Thus Bootstrap Club Tickets are their own market.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your admission to our Discord is contingent on owning a ticket,
        the moment you sell you’ll be ejected.
      </p>

      <h2>Guide for OpenSea n00bs</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Get <a href="https://metamask.io">Metamask</a> and create your “wallet”</li>
        <li>At OpenSea, pick your ticket and click <i>Buy</i></li>
        <li>Buy Ethereum using Metamask† (buy 50% more than you need because of gas fees‡)</li>
        <li>Bridge your ETH to Polygon✻</li>
        <li>Complete the purchase</li>
        <li>The Discord invite link is the Ticket’s unlockable content</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Your ticket is now assigned to your wallet.
        It’s yours in a way that very little property in this world can be.
      </p>
      <p>
        † There are numerous ways to buy Ethereum, but we recommend this way if you’re new.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‡ Gas is very expensive on Ethereum right now, it varies during the day.
        To save money buy gas at midnight EST. You can check gas prices via Google.
      </p>
      <p>
        ✻ Polygon is a “layer 2” network on top of Ethereum with zero gas fees.
        However you have to bridge Ethereum to Polygon and requires a gas fee.
      </p>

      <h2>OpenSea, NFTs, Polygon, Metamask, etc.</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Ethereum is going up, your ticket will be worth more tomorrow</li>
        <li>The ticket market is artificillay restricted, your ticket will be worth more tomorrow</li>
        <li>There’s a chance this NFT collection will capture attention and your ticket might significantly increase in value</li>
        <li>Polygon is a side-chain to Ethereum. You can transfer your ticket to the Ethereum blockchain. You buy using Polygon “wrapped” Ethereum.</li>
        <li>You will need Chrome and the Metamask extension installed to purchase on OpenSea.</li>
        <li>You can buy Ethereum and bridge it to Polygon using Opensea (via Metamask).</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Legal</h2>
      <div>
        You own the NFT.
        The club itself is not a legal entity.
        Membership is complimentary for ticket owners.
      </div>

      <h2>NFT Strategy</h2>
      <div>
        Some tickets will be worth more than others.
        Check the properties for rare traits.
        The tickets are numbered according to their popularity in Homebrew.
        web3 related tickets have a premium price.
        You can influence the floor price: if the club gets wider attention the value of its NFT collection will rise accordingly.
      </div>

      <h2>Detritus</h2>
      <p>
        You can take a guess at the club membership numbers from the number
        of that have been purchased at least once on OpenSea.</p>
