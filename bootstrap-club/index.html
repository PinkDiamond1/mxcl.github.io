        Big Tech see you as a cog in their machine.
        You’re a developer or a designer, a UX expert or a marketing guru, a product director or a…
        whatever; you’re assigned a title and you stay in your lane.
      </p>
      <p>
        This has always irked you—you’ve never done just one job, <b>you do all of them.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        There’s no place for you in Big Tech. In fact, <i>they actively don’t want you</i>.<br />
        They know you’d rock the boat.
      </p>
      <h2>Introducing Bootstrap Club</h2>
      <p>
        We made a place for you.
        Join an exclusive, members&hyphen;only club of innovators who <i>get you</i>.
        Network with like&hyphen;minded superstars; meet, learn, and grow.
      </p>
      <h2>What You Get</h2>
      <p>
        Exclusive access to our private Discord full of like minded top-tier
        entrepeneurs, all experts (or budding experts)
        at programming, product, architecture, marketing, sales and innovation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>The #general channel is noisy but <i>oh what wonderful noise</i>.</li>
          <li>The #kindling channel is where your tiny sparks of ideas are fleshed out and turned into your next big idea.</li>
          <li>We have channels for specific topics in spaces that are new, untapped and opportunities for makers.</li>
          <li>A continuously supplemented list of relatively unknown resources linking to websites, newsletters, Twitter personalities and tools to help you on your journey</li>
          <li>Anonymously submitted success <b>and/or</b> failure stories from our community so we can all learn together</li>
        </ul>
        New channels will be added as our community takes shape.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also have an exclusive and unique perk, <b>a private channel
          of the five people who joined at the same time as you</b>.
        We believe five people is the right number of people to start something special.
        We believe you will prove it.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is also an invite&hyphen;only channel for the cream of our community.
        We are unashamedly meritocratic.

      <h2>Joining Bootstrap Club</h2>
      <p>
        Membership requires a ticket. Tickets are NFTs listed on <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/bootstrap-club">OpenSea</a>.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Tickets were initially priced at 0.029Ξ and 0.0149Ξ</li>
        <li>Each morning the buyable supply will be supplemented up to at least one (as necessary)</li>
        <li>New tickets are listed for 24 hours at 150% the floor price</li>
        <li>Each morning unsold tickets will be relisted 10% reduced (excluding web3 tickets)</li>
        <li>Relisted tickets will not be reduced lower than 80% of the collection’s floor</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The above rules maintain a price&hyphen;correcting market with built in scarcity.
        Thus your ticket has <i>intrinsic value</i>;
        as more people join and demand increases the value will increase accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tickets are non-fungible,
        thus you are free to sell your ticket at any time at any price on any (NFT) marketplace.
        If you sell them on OpenSea they will be listed alongside ours.
        Thus Bootstrap Club Tickets are their own market.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your admission to our Discord is contingent on owning a ticket,
        the moment you sell you’ll be ejected.
      </p>

      <h2>Guide for OpenSea n00bs</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Get <a href="https://metamask.io">Metamask</a> and create your “wallet”</li>
        <li>At OpenSea, pick your ticket and click <i>Buy</i></li>
        <li>Buy Ethereum using Metamask† (buy 50% more than you need because of gas fees‡)</li>
        <li>Bridge your ETH to Polygon✻</li>
        <li>Complete the purchase</li>
        <li>The Discord invite link is the Ticket’s unlockable content</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Your ticket is now assigned to your wallet.
        It’s yours in a way that very little property in this world can be.
      </p>
      <p>
        † There are numerous ways to buy Ethereum,
        but we recommend this way if you’re new.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‡ Gas is a fee charged by the Ethereum network for every transaction.
        Currently it is (very) expensive, but it varies during the day.
        Try midnight EST.
      </p>
      <p>
        ✻ Polygon is a “layer 2” network on top of Ethereum with zero gas fees.
        However bridging Ethereum to Polygon requires a gas fee.
      </p>

      <p style="opacity: 0.617">
        Buying ETH with Metamask is expensive.
        Instead you may want to use a
        <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/join/mxcl">cryptocurrency exchange</a>
        (that’s my referral link—we both get $10)
        and then transfer that money to Metamask.
        The problem is that for most countries there is a minimum wait time
        before you can transfer your ETH out of the exchange.
        In the US it’s four days.

      <h2>About the NFTs</h2>
      <p>
        The tickets are each based on formula from Homebrew and are being created in
        descending order of popularity based on an initial pull of the data on September
        29th. You can use this to predict when certain formula will be represented.
      </p>
      <p>
        The images are hand&hyphen;selected representing the most arduous part of the creation
        process. Most of the rest of the steps are automated and with time will be fully
        automated. At which point I will probably release the scripts as open source.
      </p>
      <p>
        I created the formula for bitcoin and Ethereum earlier than they would have
        otherwise been represented. I may continue to do this for other blockchain
        related formula.
      </p>

      <h2>NFT Strategy</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Some tickets will be worth more than others.</li>
        <li>Check the properties for rare traits.</li>
        <li>The tickets are numbered according to their popularity in Homebrew.</li>
        <li>web3 related tickets have a premium price.</li>
        <li>You can influence the floor price: if the club gets wider attention the value of its NFT collection will rise accordingly.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Detritus</h2>
      <p>
        You can take a guess at the club membership numbers from the number
        of that have been purchased at least once on OpenSea.
      </p>

      <h2>Legal</h2>
      <div>
        You own the NFT.
        The club itself is not a legal entity.
        Membership is complimentary for ticket owners.
